00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.050 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: Today I'm speaking
with Rich Thompson, Director

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Supply Chain
and Logistics Group

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.430 align:middle line:90%
at Jones Lang LaSalle.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Rich.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:90%
RICH THOMPSON: Oh, thanks, Jean.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.996 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: I know you
work with a lot of retailers

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their site
selection decisions

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to warehousing
and distribution facilities.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the issues
driving those decisions

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:90%
these days?

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Well, I think the
basic site selection decisions

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
are being made on some
of the criteria which

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:84%
you would expect and has
always really been the case.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
As you know, supply
chain professionals

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:84%
are always trying to
balance cost and service.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:90%
That's their game.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to cost as
it relates to a distribution

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.400 align:middle line:84%
center, it's all
about freight costs.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:90%
It's all about inventory cost.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all about labor costs.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And the real estate aspect
is critical to get right,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
but it's a smaller percentage
of the total operating costs.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
On the service
side, of course, you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
know that is very much driven
by the individual company.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's a balance
of those things.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the big cost
buckets that I just

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
mentioned with that of their
customer service requirements.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.680 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: It seems that
we've gone through fads where

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:84%
you see centralization
and then greater

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
distribution getting out
closer to the customer.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.554 align:middle line:90%
How does that look these days?

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Well, that's
an interesting question.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Because, as you know and I think
as most of our retail clients

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
have been concerned, it's
with increasing freight costs.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's our point of view as
well that transportation costs

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.260 align:middle line:84%
will continue to escalate
over the coming years, driven

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
not only by oil prices, but a
whole variety of other factors.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And so as freight costs
go up, academically you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
would think you would have
more facilities closer

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.690 align:middle line:90%
to your customer.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.410 align:middle line:84%
We're actually not seeing
that right now in reality.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in our
business what we're seeing

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a real scarcity
of the bigger facilities,

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
the bigger distribution
centers, meaning over

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400 align:middle line:84%
500,000 square feet in
big primary markets.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's where the demand is.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we find that
surprising from the standpoint

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that the economy is
still pretty-- you know,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:84%
pretty shaky, up and
down, hasn't really

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:90%
turned the corner yet.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Although there's
cautious optimism,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I think, right now is
how I would explain it.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think as the
economy turns and I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.030 align:middle line:84%
think as freight
costs go up, I think

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.850 align:middle line:84%
we'll see a greater
emphasis on what we would

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:90%
call the second tier markets.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see a
tendency for companies

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
to want to have more facilities
closer to their customer.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: In the
commercial retail market,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.560 align:middle line:84%
did we see the same
kind of decline

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in demand that we saw
in the housing market?

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.510 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Yes,
you know I wouldn't

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:84%
put the sort of
personal housing market

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and the commercial real estate
market on the same plane,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
but there was very
much a turn down

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
in the commercial
real estate world.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
As you know, in
supply chain it's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
all about industrial real
estate-- plants and warehouses

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:90%
and distribution centers.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was clearly a big
turn down in that marketplace.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But what we saw was that
the bigger companies

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:84%
were sort of taking
advantage of that downturn

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and sort of upgrading
in their space needs.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So if they were in what we
call a Class B facility,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.220 align:middle line:84%
they were upgrading
and making changes

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their
distribution center needs

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.200 align:middle line:84%
in a way to sort of take
advantage of the down economy.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so I think some of
the smarter companies that

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.550 align:middle line:84%
knew they were going to
survive it were smart

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and did take advantage
of the downturn.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Right Right.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We hear so much about
the infrastructure

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.610 align:middle line:84%
in this country and the
need to improve our roads.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And not so much the railroads
at this point, I don't think.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But my question is, how is
the infrastructure or the lack

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:84%
of infrastructure improvements
impacting decisions

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that companies can make
about where they have

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.739 align:middle line:90%
their distribution facilities?

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Well, you know
that's an interesting question.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely agree with
you that the supply chain

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
infrastructure in the US is in
need of investment and repair.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of talk, and
you read a lot about that.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in agreement that
now would be a good time

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to reinvest in those key
assets-- highways and bridges

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and ports and other critical
aspects of our infrastructure.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that really
impacting site selection

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:90%
decisions, however.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, as it relates
to sort of highways,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't see any-- or
bridges-- I don't see anyone

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
evaluating those-- call it
risk issues or considerations--

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:90%
as a part of site selection.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
It certainly comes into play
a little bit on the port side.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's less
about infrastructure

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and more about depth and
development around the ports.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's an important
issue to our economy.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully we'll see
some direct investments,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
and some people getting
to work on those kinds

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.767 align:middle line:84%
of important things
for our economy.

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: Are there
any other innovations

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
in the supply chain or in
the technology that you

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
see impacting the way
your customers are

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:90%
acting in the marketplace?

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON:
Being here at RILA

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and having spent some time
with our big retail clients,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
I think it's clear that one
of the fastest growing aspects

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:90%
of retail is e-commerce.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And companies now recognize,
especially retailers,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that they need to bring
those skill sets in-house.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's no longer going
to really be sustainable

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:90%
for them to outsource that.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's not true
of every company,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
but certainly, I think, on
some of the larger companies.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
heard from Laura Sen today,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
who is the CEO of
BJ's Wholesale Club,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
is that systems are critical
to that, and the technology.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
talking about the biggest

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.900 align:middle line:84%
challenge for retailers, which
is omnichannel, multichannel,

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.180 align:middle line:84%
however you want
to think about it--

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
enables that success clearly

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
is having the IT systems to be
able to be sophisticated enough

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.200 align:middle line:90%
to manage that process.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know she described
it as a big concern.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I also know
that Amazon would

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
place a huge amount of
emphasis on their success

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
in e-commerce due to their
very much proprietary system.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's clearly an important
technology to retailers today.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: Help me understand
how this omnichannels compare

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.960 align:middle line:90%
to multichannels.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
How much of a step
increase is it?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean exactly?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Well, you know,
I use them interchangeably.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people refer
to multichannel strategy,

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
meaning you might have a
traditional retail distribution

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
center that's primary
role in the past

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:84%
has been to service
the retail store, which

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
is a different
delivery mechanism,

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:84%
or requires different
technology and material

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:84%
handling, equipment,
and everything else,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and different sizing and
everything, design and layout.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the traditional,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
dedicated e-commerce
facility like an Amazon might

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
have, which is very high
tech, large amount of labor,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:90%
very seasonal.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And then you have what
we call or are referring

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to as multichannel
or omnichannel,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
meaning it kind of
does everything.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that's the
holy grail for retail today

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:84%
is getting that figured
out in a way that works

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:90%
for your particular company.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I think of them as
kind of interchangeable.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But really what it means
to me is having the ability

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
to do more than one thing
out of a distribution center.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: OK, thanks
for clarifying that.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So are there any other
trends that you're watching?

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Well, I
think the key thing still

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
today, Jean-- and I'd like to
come up with a really hot trend

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to share with you-- but
it's cost reduction,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:90%
and it's cost mitigation.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting today
at the RILA conference.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
They did a survey of all
the retailers present.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And they said, do
you feel the economy

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and the current political
situation in the US

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
is helping your business now
or hurting your business?

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was
variations on that.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But 70% of the respondents
today indicated

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that the economy was still
hurting their business

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
or had a slightly negative
impact on their business.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
think about that,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's true
from what we're hearing,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
companies are still very
cost conscious and working

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to mitigate increasing freight
costs and other concerns

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:90%
in their business.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But also want to
enable the growth

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.110 align:middle line:90%
in areas such as e-commerce.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So you know nothing that's
a silver bullet today.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But still very much
a focus on keeping

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.754 align:middle line:84%
the business rolling and
keeping costs under control.

00:09:37.754 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: Do you
have any projections

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:84%
as to when that might turn,
in terms of our perception,

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.180 align:middle line:90%
at least, of the economy?

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: You know
I wish I did, Jean.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
You know the economy
question's an interesting one.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I do think companies are
cautiously optimistic.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a lot of great
sort of economic indicators

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.440 align:middle line:84%
that suggest that the
economy is coming out

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.760 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of lull period
we've been experiencing

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:90%
for the past several years.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
The real question to me is
how quickly will it come out.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I am of the opinion
that the economy

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:84%
has kind of made a
turn for the better

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:90%
and will continue to climb out.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
But the question is
at what trajectory?

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Because that will have an
impact on trucking capacity

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and other concerns that
I think are very real.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: All right,
great information.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.055 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:10:29.055 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
RICH THOMPSON: Oh thanks
for having me, Jean.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
JEAN MURPHY: I've been speaking
with Rich Thompson of Jones

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Lang LaSalle.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for watching.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:45.676 align:middle line:90%
