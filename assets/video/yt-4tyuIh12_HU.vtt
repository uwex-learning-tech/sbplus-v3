Hello, students.

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm Amy Henniges.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.400 align:middle line:90%
And I'll be your
instructor for the HIM 310

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:90%
course on health care
systems in organizations.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.550 align:middle line:90%
You can feel free
to call me Amy.

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you a
little bit about myself.

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm a registered nurse.

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And I've been a nurse
for over 30 years.

9
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.160 align:middle line:90%
I initially graduated from
the Bellin School of Nursing

10
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.089 align:middle line:90%
with a three-year
diploma in nursing an

11
00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%
and then went on to complete
my bachelor's degree

12
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:90%
in nursing from the University
of Wisconsin, Green Bay.

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And then it took a part-time
approach to graduate school

14
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
as I started a family.

15
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:90%
And I graduated
from the University

16
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:90%
of Wisconsin, Oshkosh, with
a master's degree in nursing,

17
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:90%
where I focused on
being a nurse educator.

18
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm also currently certified
in case management.

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I can relate to college
students because I

20
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.030 align:middle line:90%
know what it's like
to be in your shoes

21
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.159 align:middle line:90%
and to balance work life
with a busy family life.

22
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm currently the Director
of the Counseling and Health

23
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.147 align:middle line:90%
Center on campus here
at UW, Green Bay.

24
00:00:59.147 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And I have the privilege of
working with students nearly

25
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
every day in that role as well.

26
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I've taught at
the Bellin College

27
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and at Northeast Wisconsin
Technical College as well.

28
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm currently married
for over 30 years.

29
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:90%
And I have three
young adult children.

30
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Two are recent college grads
and one is a senior in college.

31
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:90%
In my spare time, I
enjoy quilting and baking

32
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and spending time with
family and friends,

33
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
especially up north at
our cabin in Eagle River.

34
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I am super excited to be your
instructor for this course

35
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:90%
because I have worked across
the health care continuum.

36
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
In my early years, I worked
in the acute hospital,

37
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:90%
then on to home health care,
acute inpatient rehabilitation,

38
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:90%
where we piloted a
model of case management

39
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and I went on to actually become
the director of case management

40
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:90%
for a local hospital and
supervise case managers working

41
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:90%
in the inpatient, outpatient,
and emergency room settings.

42
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
And now, currently, I'm
working in college health.

43
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:90%
And over the last 30
years, I've really

44
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:90%
witnessed how much technology
enhances health care.

45
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
I've had the opportunity
to spearhead and launch

46
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:90%
two different
electronic documentation

47
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:90%
systems in two
different settings.

48
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm super passionate,
also, about

49
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:90%
interdisciplinary
collaboration and care

50
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
for patients and clients.

51
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And I truly respect a vital
role that health information

52
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:90%
management plays in
our health care system.

53
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I can vouch for how clear and
concise documentation not only

54
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:90%
communicates care, but also
helps us coordinate care

55
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
for patients and clients.

56
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:90%
And how clear and concise
documentation is also

57
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:90%
critical to reimbursement, which
is so important in health care.

58
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:90%
I'd like, next, to just review
the expectations of the course.

59
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:90%
What I expect from
you, as a student,

60
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:90%
is that you'll
complete the readings

61
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:90%
as assigned prior
to the discussions.

62
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:90%
And that you'll be contributing
to our class discussions

63
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and exercises.

64
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:90%
And that you'll be making timely
postings on the discussion

65
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
board.

66
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.909 align:middle line:90%
And that you'll help us stay
on track with our schedule.

67
00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll also expect that
you'll be comfortable

68
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%
using the online library
at your local school,

69
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:90%
and that you'll really plan
to invest at least nine

70
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:90%
hours a week in doing the
readings, the preparation,

71
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and the assignments, as this
is a three credit course.

72
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:90%
What you can expect from
me, as your instructor,

73
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:90%
is that I'll respond
to emails and postings

74
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible.

75
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.220 align:middle line:90%
And you'll find that
most of my responses

76
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:90%
will occur in the
evenings and on weekends.

77
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:90%
But I also will be available for
more urgent needs by cell phone

78
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:90%
and my cell phone number
is listed on the news page.

79
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:90%
I also plan to provide
challenging thoughts and ideas

80
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%
as well as rhetorical
questions back to you

81
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:90%
to get you to think more deeply
and to expand on your ideas,

82
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%
based on my 30 years of
experience in health care.

83
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:90%
And I will be
following the grading

84
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
rubric listed in the syllabus.

85
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:90%
In summary, I look forward
to partnering with you

86
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:84%
in this course.

87
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I hope that you will
find me accessible.

88
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:90%
I really feel like we're
all in this together.

89
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:90%
I wish you good
luck in the course.

90
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:90%
And I hope that
you will enjoy it.

91
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.
