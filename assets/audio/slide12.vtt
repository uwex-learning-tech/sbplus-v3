OK, a bit of cookie
troubleshooting-- just a couple

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.650 align:middle line:90%
tips.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.120 align:middle line:84%
First, the problem of unevenly
baked batches of cookies.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.140 align:middle line:84%
If you portion the cookies
out on your pan evenly

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting
inconsistent results,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:84%
it might be that your
oven heats unevenly.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.660 align:middle line:84%
The solution here is to rotate
the pan in the oven midway

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.110 align:middle line:90%
through the baking process.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Second problem, the cookies
have overly crisp edges.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
This comes from not
chilling the cookies.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
If the dough is warm
from the mixing process

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and put right in the
oven, the cookie dough

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.320 align:middle line:84%
can spread out faster and
farther than you want.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
This makes for cookies with
thin edges that crisp up.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Always remember to
chill the dough.
