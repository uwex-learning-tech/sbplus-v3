While the first chocolate

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.900 align:middle line:84%
was published in

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.410 align:middle line:84%

Further, did you know
that the Oreo cookie

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.550 align:middle line:84%
is a knock-off of what is
known as the Hydrox cookie?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.410 align:middle line:84%
The Hydrox cookie
was invented in 1908.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.930 align:middle line:90%
The Oreo came along in 1912.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And then in the late 1930s,
the chocolate chip cookie

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:90%
was invented.
