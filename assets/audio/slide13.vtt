00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, some chocolate
chip cookie variance.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.620 align:middle line:84%
First up is mint
chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.130 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways
to do this variant.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.780 align:middle line:84%
First is to add a half
teaspoon of peppermint extract.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.940 align:middle line:84%
The second method is to
use mint chocolate chips.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Both of these should
give great results

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:90%
Next up are M&M cookies.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:84%
This one's pretty
straightforward.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
You just use M&M candies
instead of chocolate chips.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And, lastly, white chocolate
chip cranberry cookies.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
In this case, you would replace
the 2 cups of chocolate chips

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
with 3/4 cup of
white chocolate chips

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and 3/4 cup of
dried cranberries.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And that wraps up
this week's lesson

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:90%
on chocolate chip cookies.
