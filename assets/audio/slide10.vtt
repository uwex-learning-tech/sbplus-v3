00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Step 8: next, we want to place
the dough in the refrigerator

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.600 align:middle line:90%
for 20 minutes.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Chilling it will help the
cookies bake evenly, spread out

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.630 align:middle line:84%
less on the pan, and give
them that chewy inside

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.580 align:middle line:90%
and crisp outside.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.617 align:middle line:84%
Step 9: line your baking
sheets with parchment paper.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:18.200 align:middle line:84%
This will make sure
your cookies don't

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.820 align:middle line:84%
get stubbornly stuck to your
pan, and allow for easier clean

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Step 10: now we spoon equal
amounts of cookie dough

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:90%
on to the cookie sheets.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The balls of dough that
you add to the cookie sheet

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
should be between one and
1 and 1/2 inch in diameter.
