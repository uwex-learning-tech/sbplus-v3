00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Step three.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Sift the flour, salt, and
baking soda into a mixing bowl.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.119 align:middle line:90%
Mix them together thoroughly.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.330 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have a sifter,
you can use a whisk instead.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.360 align:middle line:84%
It's important to break
up the tiny clumps

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and mix the
ingredients together.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.500 align:middle line:90%
Step four.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Pour the butter, the brown
sugar, white sugar, and vanilla

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:90%
into the second mixing bowl.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Mix the butter and
sugars until you

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
have a smooth, consistent,
semi-thick liquid.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
To ensure your cookies are
light, fluffy, and not flat,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.760 align:middle line:84%
be sure to beat the mixture
for at least four minutes.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
This is where an electric
mixer can be helpful.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
During mixing, be sure to
periodically scrape the bowl

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.054 align:middle line:84%
and add it back
into the mixture.

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
If too much of the
ingredients are

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.265 align:middle line:84%
left on the side
of the bowl, you

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:90%
will have inconsistent results.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Step five.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Add the two eggs to
the wet ingredients.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Beat the mixture
for another minute

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to get the eggs
thoroughly mixed in.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Step six.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Slowly add the dry ingredients
to the wet ingredients bowl.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Add in a small amount at a time,
beating the mixture constantly.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You'll want to keep an eye
out for clumping flour.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.490 align:middle line:90%
Step seven.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Mix in the chocolate chips.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Add these in slowly,
being sure to mix them

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:90%
in well between each addition.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
If they are all
added at once, they

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
may congregate into
groups, giving your cookies

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
an inconsistent amount of
chocolate chips from cookie

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:90%
to cookie.
