OK, part one of the steps to
make chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.470 align:middle line:84%

preheat our oven.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be preheating
it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Next, melt the butter in
a small saucepan on low.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.405 align:middle line:84%

the butter burn.

00:00:18.405 --> 00:00:22.250 align:middle line:84%
