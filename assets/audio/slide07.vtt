00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.320 align:middle line:90%
You will also need a few tools.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.860 align:middle line:84%
First, you'll need two
large mixing bowls.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We'll be using one to mix our
dry ingredients and the other

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.220 align:middle line:90%
for wet ingredients.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Later, we will mix them
together into one bowl.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.542 align:middle line:84%
You will also need
baking sheets.

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The size of your
baking sheets will

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:90%
determine how many you need.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:90%
You'll need a small saucepan.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll use this to
melt the butter.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.250 align:middle line:90%
An electric mixer is optional.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But to get the best
possible cookie dough

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:84%
mixture with the least
amount of physical effort,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
I recommend using
an electric mixer.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Also optional is a flour sifter.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.920 align:middle line:84%
A flour sifter will help evenly
mix the flour and baking soda.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:84%
It does this by breaking up
the tiny clumps that can form

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.750 align:middle line:90%
in the flour and baking soda.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to the steps.
