Step 11-- bake the cookies
for 15 to 20 minutes,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.740 align:middle line:90%
or until they are golden brown.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Step 12-- let the cookies
cool for five minutes

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.870 align:middle line:84%
on the parchment paper in
the pan before removing them.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.129 align:middle line:84%
This will allow them
to firm up a bit

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
so they stay together
nicely when you store them.
