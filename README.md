# Storybook Plus (SB+)  
**version 3.3.3**

---

Storybook Plus is a web application that uses HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and web storage to deliver multimedia presentations. As with any other web applications, the choice of web browsers is the most critical rather than the operating systems. JavaScript must be enabled no matter which web browser is utilized. SB+ does not use cookies; however, it does use both local and session web storages.

**Recommended web browsers (lastest stable version):**
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Mozilla Firefox
* Apple Safari
* Opera

**Recommendations for accessibilities/assistive technologies:**
* Windows OS (check screen reader requirements for additional details)
* JAWS (version 16+)
* NVDA (latest version)
* Windows Eyes (version 8+)
* VoiceOver on iOS (iPhone/iPad)

Notes: most visually impaired users started out using screenreader with Internet Explorer prepackaged. However, and unfortunately, Microsoft stops supporting accessibilities as newer versions of Internet Explorer were released. Storybook Plus will cause additional restrictions for screen reader due to Microsoftâ€™s non-existent accessibility supports for HTML5 on Internet Explorer including their latest web browser application, Microsoft Edge. Based on our user testing results, visually impaired users are moving toward Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.

SB+ may not function properly with beta or pre-release versions of web browsers. Please use the latest stable version for the best experience.
