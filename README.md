# Storybook Plus (SB+)  
**version 3.4.2**

---

Storybook Plus is a web application that uses HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, and web storage to deliver multimedia presentations. As with any other web applications, the choice of web browsers is the most critical rather than the operating systems. JavaScript must be enabled no matter which web browser is utilized. SB+ does not use cookies; however, it does use both local and session web storages.

**Recommended web browsers (latest stable version):**
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Mozilla Firefox
* Apple Safari
* Opera

**Recommendations for accessibility/assistive technologies:**
* Windows OS (check screen reader requirements for additional details)
* JAWS (version 16+)
* NVDA (latest version)
* Windows Eyes (version 8+)
* VoiceOver on iOS (iPhone/iPad)

SB+ may not function properly with beta or pre-release versions of web browsers. Please use the latest stable version for the best experience.
